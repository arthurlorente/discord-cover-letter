    <p>"Arthur, you have talked a few times about how you like your current role and you can apply things that you like to it. So why are you moving on?"</p>
    <p>Ha, great question my recruiter friend! I was hoping you would ask it!</p>

    <p>I am not actively applying for any other jobs, but I have always closely followed Discord's LinkedIn ever since I saw an ad highlighting that Discord offers $20,000 for any procedures related to gender transition.</p>
    <p>As someone who is always striving to be a strong ally and whose partner is a part of the LGBTQIA+ community, that just resonated with me. Everything else on LinkedIn became - you guessed it - noise.</p>

    <p>I have always been a gamer. I have been through Ventrilo, Axon, Teamspeak, Skype, Mumble, you name it. Discord is the one place me and my friends were able to settle, and I have been a passionate advocate ever since. As an expat, it is what connects me to my friends that I grew up with. Discord has a similar mission as beatlog, my personal project: To allow people to create healthy gaming communities and just be themselves.</p>

    <p>Are the benefits great? Yes. The pay looks good? For sure. Would Discord be an amazing opportunity to get closer to the Bay Area and all things tech related that I love so much? Definitely. Do I think the position is a great fit? Of course!</p>

    <p>It goes beyond that, though. Discord has consistently shown itself to be <strong>a place where people do good</strong>. It is not just about pay, location, position fit. I am already currently satisfied when it comes to these things. My motivation comes from the powerful values inherent to Discord as a piece of Software and as a company. This is what makes me want to be a part of it. <strong>I want to build belonging.</strong></p>
