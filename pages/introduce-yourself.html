  <p>My name is Arthur Lorente, I am originally from Brazil but I hail from Indianapolis, Indiana. I am currently the Lifecycle Marketing Manager at Kenzie Academy, a non-profit EdTech based off Indianapolis that offers scalable training in Software Engineering and UX Design to populations traditionally underserved by Higher Education.</p>
  <p>I was born and raised in SÃ£o Paulo, which is one of the biggest metro areas in the world. I went to one of the best public research institutions in the country, but dropped out on Day #1 after my professor walked into the classroom and openly told us nobody there was really there for us, but for the research. Not a great experience, right?</p>
  <p>I started studying Software Engineering on my own through Harvard's CS50, one of their introductory courses in Computer Science. I loved it, and decided that this is exactly what I wanted my education to look like.</p>
  <p>Fast forward a few years and here we are! I arrived in the United States in 2016 and got my degree in Marketing and Management from the University of Evansville in Evansville, Indiana, and the rest is history!</p>
