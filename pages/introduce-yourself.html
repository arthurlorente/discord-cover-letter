    <p>I was born and raised in SÃ£o Paulo, which is one of the biggest metro areas in the world. I went to one of the best public research institutions in the country, but dropped out on Day #1 after my professor walked into the classroom and openly told us nobody there was really there for us, but for the research. Not a great experience, right?</p>

    <p>I started studying Software Engineering on my own through Harvard's CS50, one of their introductory courses in Computer Science. I loved it, and decided that this is exactly what I wanted my education to look like.</p>

    <p>I am passionate about Information Architecture, Teaching and Database Administration. I assist my team by constantly creating (and revising) our bank of technical documents and tutorials as well as maintaining a sales enablement focused project board, which has allowed me to create an impact that goes way beyond my own daily work.</p>

    <p>On my free time, you may find me playing bass guitar, learning Mandarin, studying UX Design, spending time with my wife & my dog and working as the Product Manager (more like a Jack-of-all-trades) at beatlog.</p>
