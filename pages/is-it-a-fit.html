    <p>The golden question. After all the niceties, stories and introductions, nothing matters if there is not a fit between myself, Discord and the position.</p>
    <p>So why do I think there is a fit?</p>

    <p>I have been working and interfacing directly with Marketing teams for almost 10 years now, starting from the very beginning by conducting market research operations for clients while in college all the way to owning the entire customer lifecycles, communications, operations and marketing automations across companies. I am one of these people that eats revenue operations content for breakfast.</p>

    <p>I understand the needs and wants of creators and their communities. As a moderator of a creator's Discord community myself, I have lived the Discord user journey, which is both meaningful and important to me.</p>

    <p>I have extensive experience working in cross functional teams, mainly across Revenue and Development. I am often the person that bridges communications between technical and non-technical teams.</p>

    <p>Scaling is essential to any business. As an entrepreneur myself, I am constantly thinking about the scalability of products and processes. I definitely believe in working hard, but I am a much bigger fan of working smart!</p>
    <p>When you put all of that together, I think you have the perfect recipe for a HubSpot Admin - I am ready to dive into everything Discord. I want to help the place which has been my second home build even more belonging.</p>
