    <p>Okay, I have to admit- I am glad you are still here and reading.</p>
    <p>I started my professional journey back in 2008, translating official news tickers and stories for an online MMO community. </p>
    <p>Since then, a lot has happened. I have been a math & physics tutor, I worked in International Education side-by-side with the Department of State and even started my own ventures. Throughout all of them, the common denominator has been my involvement and dedication in the operational side of things.</p>

    <p>I have dedicated the past six years of my life to HubSpot teams, supporting revenue, engineering and product teams alike. Because of my international background, I have been able to navigate a number of different situations with ease, and constantly serve as the liaison between my team and our teams in EMEA, APAC and LATAM. <img width="22" height="22" aria-label="ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·" src="assets/flag_br.svg" alt="ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·" draggable="false" class="emoji"> <img width="22" height="22" aria-label="ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½" src="assets/flag_mx.svg" alt="ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½" draggable="false" class="emoji"> <img width="22" height="22" aria-label="ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸" src="assets/flag_us.svg" alt="ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸" draggable="false" class="emoji"> <img width="22" height="22" aria-label="ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³" src="assets/flag_cn.svg" alt="ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³" draggable="false" class="emoji"></p>

    <p>Here are some of the most thrilling experiences I had during my professional journey:</p>
    <p>- I started a business from the ground up! I started a venture in college prep back in Brazil, saw it flourish, saw it fall and learned a lot all along the journey;</p>
    <p>- I travelled along with the Department of State representing my employer and helping recruit international talent to come and study in the US back in my home country of Brazil;</p>
    <p>- I experienced what life is like in a successful, rapidly growing startup, from our Series C all the way to acquisition. <img width="22" height="22" aria-label="ðŸ¥³" src="assets/partying_face.svg" alt="ðŸ¥³" draggable="false" class="emoji"> <img width="22" height="22" aria-label="ðŸŽˆ" src="assets/balloon.svg" alt="ðŸŽˆ" draggable="false" class="emoji"> <img width="22" height="22" aria-label="ðŸŽŠ" src="assets/confetti_ball.svg" alt="ðŸŽŠ" draggable="false" class="emoji"></p>
      <p>- I have set up HubSpot for teams and customers exhaustively, setting up marketing, revenue and operation automations that have enabled everything from revenue tracking to free trial-led product motions using webhooks and API connections through HubSpot.</p>

    <p>And these are some of my most important values - I carry them with me regardless of where I go or what I am doing:</p>
    <p>- <strong>I give a sh*t.</strong> If I am doing something, it is because I care about it;</p>
    <p>- <strong>I keep learning.</strong> I will never know everything, but the more knowledge I have, the better human being I can become;</p>
    <p>- <strong>I am competitive.</strong> Not in a crazy way, but mostly with myself. I might not be the best in a particular area, but I always strive to improve. If I'm not competing at the top now, I know I will be in the future;</p>
    <p>- <strong>I preach empathy, compassion and vulnerability.</strong> I believe in calling people in rather than calling them out. I believe that everyone can learn from their mistakes and that the world will be a better place if we can put ourselves in other people's shoes;</p>
    <p>- <strong>I believe in servant leadership.</strong> Sometimes being a leader does not mean being the face that shows up in the important slides, but being the person that can advocate, sponsor and support. </p>
