    <p>Okay, I have to admit- I am glad you are still here and reading.</p>
    <p>I started my professional journey back in 2008, translating official news tickers and stories for an online MMO community. </p>
    <p>Since then, a lot has happened. I have been a math & physics tutor, I worked in International Education side-by-side with the Department of State and even started my own ventures. Throughout all of them, the common denominator has been my involvement and dedication in the product marketing, sales and customer experience side of things.</p>

    <p>I have dedicated the past six years of my life to Education and Tech, and have been in EdTech with Kenzie Academy for over a year now, supporting both our sales and marketing teams. Because of my international background, I have been able to navigate a number of different situations with ease - I am able to help my students in English, Portuguese and Spanish. I can't help them in Mandarin yet - but I am sure this will change soon <img width="22" height="22" aria-label="ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·" src="assets/flag_br.svg" alt="ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·" draggable="false" class="emoji"> <img width="22" height="22" aria-label="ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½" src="assets/flag_mx.svg" alt="ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½" draggable="false" class="emoji"> <img width="22" height="22" aria-label="ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸" src="assets/flag_us.svg" alt="ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸" draggable="false" class="emoji"> <img width="22" height="22" aria-label="ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³" src="assets/flag_cn.svg" alt="ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³" draggable="false" class="emoji"></p>

    <p>Here are some of the most thrilling experiences I had during my professional journey:</p>
    <p>- I started a business from the ground up! I started a venture in college prep back in Brazil, saw it flourish, saw it fall and learned a lot all along the journey;</p>
    <p>- I travelled along with the Department of State representing my employer and helping recruit international talent to come and study in the US back in my home country of Brazil;</p>
    <p>- I experienced what life is like in a successful, rapidly growing startup, from our Series C all the way to acquisition. Yes, we were acquired!! <img width="22" height="22" aria-label="ðŸ¥³" src="assets/partying_face.svg" alt="ðŸ¥³" draggable="false" class="emoji"> <img width="22" height="22" aria-label="ðŸŽˆ" src="assets/balloon.svg" alt="ðŸŽˆ" draggable="false" class="emoji"> <img width="22" height="22" aria-label="ðŸŽŠ" src="assets/confetti_ball.svg" alt="ðŸŽŠ" draggable="false" class="emoji"></p>

    <p>And these are some of my most important values - I carry them with me regardless of where I go or what I am doing:</p>
    <p>- <strong>I give a sh*t.</strong> If I am doing something, it is because I care about it;</p>
    <p>- <strong>I keep learning.</strong> I will never know everything, but the more knowledge I have, the better human being I can become;</p>
    <p>- <strong>I am competitive.</strong> Not in a crazy way, but mostly with myself. I might not be the best in a particular area, but I always strive to improve. If I'm not competing at the top now, I know I will be in the future;</p>
    <p>- <strong>I preach empathy, compassion and vulnerability.</strong> I believe in calling people in rather than calling them out. I believe that everyone can learn from their mistakes and that the world will be a better place if we can put ourselves in other people's shoes;</p>
    <p>- <strong>I believe in servant leadership.</strong> Sometimes being a leader does not mean being the face that shows up in the important slides, but being the person that can advocate, sponsor and support. </p>

    <p>There have been many ups and downs, but I am definitely proud to be where I am right now- a truly mission-driven institution that impacts thousands of lives for the better. I like to think of my wins as opportunities to celebrate, and my losses as opportunities to learn. I love celebrating and I love learning, so regardless of what happens during my journey, I know that it will always get a little bit better!</p>
